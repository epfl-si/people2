  # NOTE: since these are vary rare cases that almost never change, I wanted to
  # avoid to load from the DB at each request or, even worse, for each profile
  # The idea was to momoize the class variable for the lifetime of the application
  # and refresh it with an after_save callback. The problem is that this won't
  # work with multiple app instances as in production.
  # Therefore, for the moment I do it request-wide so that we avoid repeating
  # the request foreach profile when we have many (e.g. wsgetpeople). Probably
  # useless because AR might already detect repeated requests.
  # Another alternative is to add a `has_special_options` column in the profile
  # so we avoid the request that we know will return empty. This would mean that
  # only people aligible to have a profile can have special options which is not
  # the case with the current implementation.

  # @all_options[sciper.to_s]
